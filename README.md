# Presenter Tool using CV2 and Hand Detector Module from CVZone
This is a Presenter Tool built using the OpenCV library (cv2) and the Hand Detector Module from CVZone. It allows users to control their presentations by using hand gestures detected by their webcam.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
NumPy library
CVZone library
## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install cvzone
## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/abhinav16aero/presentertool.git
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory:

cd presenter-tool
Run the script:

python Presenter_tool.py
Once the script is running, position your hand in front of the webcam and perform the following gestures to control your presentation:

Raise your index finger to move the pointer on the slide.

Note: Make sure your hand is visible to the webcam and there is enough lighting in the room for the hand detector to work properly.

## Customization
You can customize the Presenter Tool by modifying the presenter.py file. For example, you can change the path to your presentation file, the size of the window, or the hand detection threshold.

## Credits
This Presenter Tool was built using the Hand Detector Module from CVZone, which was created by Murtaza Hassan. You can find more information about CVZone and the Hand Detector Module.
