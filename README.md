## Presenter Tool using CV2 and Hand Detector Module from CVZone
This is a Presenter Tool built using the OpenCV library (cv2) and the Hand Detector Module from CVZone. It allows users to control their presentations by using hand gestures detected by their webcam.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
NumPy library
CVZone library
Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install cvzone
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/presenter-tool.git
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd presenter-tool
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python presenter.py
Once the script is running, position your hand in front of the webcam and perform the following gestures to control your presentation:

Show the palm of your hand to start the presentation.
Close your fist to move to the next slide.
Raise your index finger to go back to the previous slide.
Raise your middle finger to end the presentation.
Note: Make sure your hand is visible to the webcam and there is enough lighting in the room for the hand detector to work properly.

Customization
You can customize the Presenter Tool by modifying the presenter.py file. For example, you can change the path to your presentation file, the size of the window, or the hand detection threshold.
